# Task-Board-Application

This project aims to develop a task board application to help individuals and teams organize and manage their project tasks efficiently. The task board provides a visual representation of tasks, their progress status, and deadlines.

## Key Features

- **Task Visualization**: Tasks are displayed in columns representing their progress status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
- **Deadline Tracking**: Tasks are color-coded to indicate if they are on track, nearing the deadline, or overdue.
- **Task Creation**: Users can easily add new tasks with details such as title, description, and deadline.
- **Task Management**: Users can drag and drop tasks between columns to update their progress.
- **Task Deletion**: Tasks can be removed from the board when completed or no longer needed.
- **Data Persistence**: Task data is saved using localStorage to ensure persistence across browser sessions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- LocalStorage for data persistence
