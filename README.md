# Task-Board-Application
This project aims to develop a task board application to help individuals and teams organize and manage their project tasks efficiently. The task board will provide a visual representation of tasks, their progress status, and deadlines.

## Key Features

*__Task Visualization__: Tasks will be displayed in columns representing their progress status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
*__Deadline Tracking__: Tasks will be color-coded to indicate if they are on track, nearing the deadline, or overdue.
*__Task Creation__: Users can easily add new tasks with details such as title, description, and deadline.
*__Task Management__: Users can drag and drop tasks between columns to update their progress.
*__Task Deletion__: Tasks can be removed from the board when completed or no longer needed.
*__Data Persistence__: Task data will be saved using localStorage to ensure persistence across browser sessions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
